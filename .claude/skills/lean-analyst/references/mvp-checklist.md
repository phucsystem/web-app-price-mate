# MVP Definition Checklist

## Before Defining MVP

- [ ] Problem clearly understood
- [ ] Target users identified
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Constraints known (time, budget, tech)

## MVP Feature Selection

For each proposed feature, ask:

1. **Value**: Does this solve a real user problem?
2. **Necessity**: Can MVP work without this?
3. **Validation**: What assumption does this test?
4. **Effort**: Is effort justified for MVP?

### Decision Matrix

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Users need this to get core value? | Include | Exclude |
| Can't launch without it? | Include | Defer |
| Tests critical assumption? | Include | Defer |
| Low effort, high value? | Include | Evaluate |

## MVP Validation Criteria

### Before Building

- [ ] At least 5 user interviews done
- [ ] Problem validated (users confirm pain)
- [ ] Solution approach validated (users understand value)
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed

### After MVP

- [ ] Core user journey works end-to-end
- [ ] Real users can complete key tasks
- [ ] Feedback collection mechanism exists
- [ ] Metrics tracking in place

## Common MVP Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Too many features | Delays launch, dilutes focus | Ruthlessly cut to core |
| Too polished | Wasted effort on unknowns | Ship rough, iterate |
| No validation plan | Build without learning | Define metrics upfront |
| Scope creep | Never launches | Freeze scope, defer additions |

## MVP Size Guide

| Project Type | Typical MVP Size | Timeline |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| SaaS Tool | 3-5 core features | 4-8 weeks |
| E-commerce | 1 category, checkout | 6-10 weeks |
| Mobile App | 1 core flow | 4-6 weeks |
| Internal Tool | 1 process automated | 2-4 weeks |
